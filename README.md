# VoteChain

# Abstract

An online voting system, that uses blockchain to ensure the security and transparency of the election being made using it.

It will use a peer-to-peer PoW blockchain similar to bitcoin's. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure.

## More to come

I just started to work on this project, more will come as I'm working on it.
